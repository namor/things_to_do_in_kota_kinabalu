# Things To Do In Kota Kinabalu

## Food

Item with `*` is highly recommended by me, recommended for that particular category.  
Some places are only good for a few things, I included suggestions in most of em.

If you need operating hours info, try googling the name.
I copied the name from Google searches.    

The search results sometimes have social media accounts tied to them.
Best check the social media accounts for the latest operation hours.
And KK businesses in general have a habit of randomly closing, especially after MCO.
